<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Zumwalt_(DDG-1000)"><addr title="United States Ship">U.S.S.</addr> Zumwalt</a> is basically a floating data center running Linux.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The $3.5 billion ship is designed for stealth, survivability, and firepower, and it's packed with advanced technology. And at the heart of its operations is a virtual data center powered by off-the-shelf server hardware, various flavors of Linux, and over 6 million lines of software code.</p>
