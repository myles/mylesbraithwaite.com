<blockquote>
<p>In a comparatively small study, 48 participants were fed sweet foods such as biscuits or salty ones such as crisps, while listening to silence or noise through headphones.  Meanwhile they rated the intensity of the flavours and of their liking.  In noisier settings, foods were rated less salty or sweet than they were in the absence of background noise, but were rated to be more crunchy.</p>
