<p><a href="http://readthefuckinghig.tumblr.com/">Read the Fucking HIG</a> is a Tumblr blog of the worst applications in the Mac App Store. HIG stands for <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGIntro/XHIGIntro.html">Human Interface Guidelines</a> a document Apple puts out on how to design your iOS and Mac applications. Though this is a great document for a company to put out (check out <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/">Gnome</a>, <a href="http://developer.kde.org/documentation/design/ui/">KDE</a>, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511258.aspx">Windows</a> guidelines) HIGs usually are not followed by a majority of application markers (include the companies that write them (just look at the new iTunes)). It only the Java-based and Open Source applications that actually adhere to the HID.</p>
