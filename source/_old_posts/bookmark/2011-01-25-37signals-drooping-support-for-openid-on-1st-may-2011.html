<p>37signals, probably the largest OpenID consumer on the internet, is dropping support for OpenID on 1st May, 2011 citing flaky OpenID providers and a huge support cost since they launched the feature in 2007. This just leaves the <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">StackExchange</a> sites as a major player in OpenID.</p>
