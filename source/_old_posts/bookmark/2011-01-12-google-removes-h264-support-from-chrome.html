<p>Google is going to be removing all proprietary video codecs in upcoming releases of Google Chrome and Chromium for open ones like WebM (VP8) and Theora. Google even address the H.264 (a proprietary codec used by both Microsoft and Apple):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though H.264 plays an important role in video, as our goal is to enable open innovation, support for the codec will be removed and our resources directed towards completely open codec technologies.</p>
