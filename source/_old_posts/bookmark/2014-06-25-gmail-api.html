<p>Interesting move by Google.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea of plugging into email contents is not new, and many outside applications already leverage mail if users allow it. But Google is creating a new application programming interface, or API, to make it easier for outside developers to plug in. It will replace IMAP, a common but complex way for applications to communicate with most email services, limiting the number of apps that can work with Gmail.
