<p>The New York Times pay wall has hit a new level of stupidity. According to this <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110322/03485913583/am-i-violating-dmca-visiting-nytimes-with-noscript-enabled.shtml" title="Am I Violating The DMCA By Visiting The NYTimes With NoScript Enabled?">techdirt article</a>, the pay wall is written in... Javascript(!) and is trivially bypassed with NoScript enabled.</p>

<p>I created a web based timecard application for a client a few months back and they wanted a feature that I felt was a little unfair to their employee's. So I implemented it entirely in JavaScript so for an employee to circumvent this feature all they would need is to block the timecard website with NoScript (which was installed by default on all their computers).</p>
<p>I wonder if a computer programmer at the New York Times had a similar moral issue.</p>
