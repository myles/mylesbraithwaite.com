<blockquote>
<p>Members of the Canadian actorsâ€™ union ACTRA have been lobbying in Ottawa for certain changes to the bill. Peter Keleghan of 18 to Life and Eric Peterson of Corner Gas both spent the past couple of days meeting with MPs. They believe that consumers are going to share files no matter what the government does. Make it legal, they say, but make the public pay. Their suggestion is that all recordable devices, from MP3 players to USB sticks, carry a levy that will be passed on to artists.</p>
