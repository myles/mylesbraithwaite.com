<p>Douglas Coupland presents 45 tips for survival. My favourite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The future isn't going to feel futuristic. It's simply going to feel weird and out-of-control-ish, the way it does now, because too many things are changing too quickly. The reason the future feels odd is because of its unpredictability. If the future didn't feel weirdly unexpected, then something would be wrong."</p>
