<blockquote>
<p>Amazon was just granted <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US8676045" title="Amazon's US Patent 8,676,045">US patent 8,676,045</a> for a very clever and particular way to arrange a raised Plexiglas platform, lights and backdrop to give instant in-camera images with a 100% white background and a slight reflection below the subject, all with no postprocessing (like Photoshop) needed to make the platform blend into the background.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Amazon's patent doesn't have anything to do with using a white background, using a light table, tent, or using a clear glass table over white, and it has nothing to do with using a blown-out white backdrop. It has everything to do with how everything is arranged to make the floor blend into the backdrop along with a slight reflection underneath.</p>
