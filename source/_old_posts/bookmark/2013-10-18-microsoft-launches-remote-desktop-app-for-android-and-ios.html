<p>Today, Microsoft, released a version of their Remote Desktop client for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.rdc.android">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id714464092">iOS</a>. Personally I can't see myself using a Remote Desktop application that doesn't have support for SSH tunnels.</p>
