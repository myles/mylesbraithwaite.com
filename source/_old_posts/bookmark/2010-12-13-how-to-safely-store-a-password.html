<p>After <a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2010/12/13/gawker-gizmodo-lifehacker-password-change/">Gawker</a> passwords were compromised it might be a good idea to look at how you are storing your passwords. Considering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A modern server can calculate the MD5 hash of about 330MB every second. If your users have passwords which are lowercase, alphanumeric, and 6 characters long, you can try every single possible password of that size in around 40 seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will have to use a third party library to use <code>bcrypt</code> in Python called <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Bcryptor">Bcryptor</a>. It has a simple enough API:</p>

```python
>>> import bcryptor
>>> 
>>> hasher = bcryptor.Bcrypt()
>>> hash = haser.create('password')
>>> 
>>> haser.valid('password', hash)
True
>>> haser.valid('Password', hash)
False
```
