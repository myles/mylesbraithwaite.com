<p>An interesting article about how the illegal drugs has moved to the Internet. Using technologies like <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/" title="Bitcoin a P2P Virtual Currency">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" title="Tor Project">TOR</a> you can have an almost anonymous transaction of illegal items. But as Jeff Garzik (a core developer of the Bitcoin project) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He explains that because all Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a public log, though the identities of all the parties are anonymous, law enforcement could use sophisticated network analysis techniques to parse the transaction flow and track down individual Bitcoin users.</p>
<p>"Attempting major illicit transactions with bitcoin, given existing statistical analysis techniques deployed in the field by law enforcement, is pretty damned dumb," he says.</p>
</blockquote>
