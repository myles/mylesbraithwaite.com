<p>TOR (or Onion Routing) was developed so the U.S. Government could have a system that allowed for bi-directional communication over the Internet where the source and destination could not be determined by a mid-point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The short answer to your question of "Why would the government do this?" 
is because it is in the best interests of some parts of the government 
to have this capability...  Now enough of the conspiracy theories...</p>

<p>This is even on the about section of TOR web site on <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en#military" title="Who uses Tor?">who uses the service</a>.</p>
