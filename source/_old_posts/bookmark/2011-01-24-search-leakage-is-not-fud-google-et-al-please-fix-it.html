<blockquote>
<p>One site having one of my search terms is irrelevant. That may generally be the case, but unfortunately, tens of millions of sites run ads from just a handful of ad networks. Those ad networks can aggregate your search terms and piece together a large percentage of your search history. </p>
<p>So the question then becomes do you care if third parties (not associated with your search engine and not bound by its privacy policy) have a significant % of your search history? If you don't care about that, then you probably don't care about Referrers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why don't we just add an option to every browser that disables the Referrers header.</p>
