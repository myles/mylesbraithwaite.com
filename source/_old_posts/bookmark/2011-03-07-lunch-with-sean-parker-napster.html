<p>The <a href="http://www.ft.com/">Financial Times</a> did a great interview on Sean Parker (co-founder of Napster, Plaxo, and Causes).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In one long breath, he describes what happened in the following 18 months: “Founded the company, launched the product, moved to California, got on my hands and knees and installed all the servers for six weeks, got introduced to my first business people and hired them and fired them, and was sued by the record labels and suddenly I’m on MTV and now we’re sponsoring raves and going to crazy parties, and then bigger and bigger and bigger. And then the company’s dead and I’m in a beach house in North Carolina getting the call, ‘Sean it doesn’t look good. I don’t think you’ll have a job when you get back.’ And then it’s over. And one day Fanning and I woke up from this dream. It felt like we’d lived through an entire lifetime of experiences.”</p>
