<blockquote>
<p>I converted an old overhead projector into a stand by taking off the projector head and adapted the arm and bracket to have a 1/4 inch camera thread mount. Then I spray painted a plywood board matte black for the imager table surface. Two old desk lamps were mounted next to the table for illumination. I hooked a Canon Powershot camera to a TV for previewing the document imager output using the cameraâ€™s NTSC video output. To enable constant focus and brightness during a capture session I used AEL (Auto Exposure Lock) and AFL (Auto Focus Lock) modes. The digital camera was powered off a wall power adapter using a Canon ACK-DC10 AC Adapter Kit.</p>
