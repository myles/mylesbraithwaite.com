<p>After thirty years of absolute no organic material, scientists say that they have found organic material in the Martian soil collected by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_program" title="Wikipedia article about the Viking program">Viking</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists repeated a key Viking experiment using perchlorate-enhanced soil from Chile's Atacama Desert, which is considered one of the driest and most Mars-like places on Earth, and found telltale fingerprints of combusted organics -- the same chemicals Viking scientists dismissed as contaminants from Earth.</p>
<p>"Contrary to 30 years of perceived wisdom, Viking did detect organic materials on Mars," planetary scientist Christopher McKay, with NASA's Ames Research Center in California, told Discovery News. "It's like a 30-year-old cold case suddenly solved with new facts."</p>
