<p>Last nights <a href="http://gtalug.org/wiki/Meetings:2011-03" title="GTALUG Meeting for March 2011">GTALUG meeting</a> was with <a href="http://sachachua.com/">Sacha Chua</a> on Note Taking with Emacs and Org-Mode. Personally I don't use Emacs, I find it's customizability counter productive, but it was really interesting to see how the other side works. Org-Mode is quite an interesting take on outlining because Emacs people can literally spend their entire day in the editor (it has a web browser, email client, address book, etc.) and you can initiate a note from anything running inside Emacs.</p>
<p>Currently my note taking process it pretty complicated, which I am trying to streamline, so seeing how Sacha takes notes was really helpful.</p>
<p>It was also good to see that she, like me, use an Outliner for personal accounting.</p>
