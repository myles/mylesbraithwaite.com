<p>Just got invited to <a href="https://vibe.novell.com">Novell Vibe</a> by <a href="http://tomlowshang.blogspot.com/" title="Tom Low-Shang">Tom</a>. It is a really interesting idea for realtime communication but way to confusing. One cool feature of Vibe is that it supports capture (you get the email address <code>&lt;username&gt;@vibe.novell.com</code>).</p>
<p>But why make me have multiple accounts per email address, that means I have to have to have at least five different accounts.</p>

<p>Anyways I hope to have a review of Vibe up in a few days (or weeks). If you would like to communicate with me on Vibe my username is <a href="https://vibe.novell.com/myles">myles</a>.</p>
