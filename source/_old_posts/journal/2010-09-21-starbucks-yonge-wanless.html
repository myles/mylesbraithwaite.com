<p>Last night after a heated GTALUG PaC meeting I came home to <a href="http://twitter.com/tomlowshang/status/25067260937">read a tweet</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/tomlowshang">Tom Low-Shang</a> about my win as Mayor of your <a href="http://www.starbucks.ca/en-ca/_Our+Stores/_Store+Locator/StoreLocatorMap.htm?StoreKey=102546">Starbucks</a> on <a href="http://foursquare.com/venue/213804">Yonge &amp; Wanless</a>. I would like to thank all who helped with my Mayoral checkins. The many late night and early morning coffee strategy meetings keep me going. We ran a good an honest race against the previous Mayor and came out victories.</p>
