<p><a href="http://benthebodyguard.com/">Ben The Bodyguard</a>, an iPhone application that will keep you securest safe was just released on the iOS App Store ether this morning or last night. It a pretty cool application that will encrypt your Passwords (web login, bank account, credit card, passport, membership, serial number, and driver's license), Notes, Contacts, and Appointments (really just notifications).</p>
<p>The only real issue I might have with the application in the future is Ben. Similar to Microsoft's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">Office Assistant</a>, he is really the major mascot of the application. He doesn't get in the way like Clippy, but it might be an issue in the future. But until then <a href="http://benthebodyguard.com/">Ben The Bodyguard</a> will be on my home screen.</p>
