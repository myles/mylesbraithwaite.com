<p>On 21 April 2009 at 7:30 pm I am going to be giving a talk about <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> at the <a href="http://linuxcaffe.ca/" rel="friend met">linuxcaffe</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> is a platform to building and hosting web applications on Google's infrastructure (which is sometimes called <abbr title="Platform as a Service">PaaS</abbr><sup><a href="#define-PaaS">1</a></sup>). It has a pay-for-what-you-use payment level but anything <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/general.html#quota">below 5 million pageviews a month</a>.</p>
