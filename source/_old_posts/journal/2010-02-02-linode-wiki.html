<p>I ordered a second <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=489fd5146a3553db67138302f6c6d44a029cf45a" title="A VPS Provider">Linode</a> (a 360) on the weekend for some PHP applications (<a href="http://feedafever.com/" title="An online feed reader.">Fever</a> and <a href="http://dokuwiki.org/" title="A super simple and powerful wiki engine.">DokuWiki</a>). I have been with many VPS services and <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=489fd5146a3553db67138302f6c6d44a029cf45a" title="A VPS Provider">Linode</a> is by far the best you can buy (shared host I will have to say <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/" title="NearlyFreeSpeech.NET Web Hosting">Nearly Free Speech</a>). It is hosted in the same data centre (Newark, NJ) so I have an internal IP address connecting both of them. I am running <a href="http://www.nagios.org/">Nagios</a> and <a href="http://munin.sourceforge.net/">Munin</a> on both computers (<a href="http://panda.mylesbraithwaite.com/munin/mylesbraithwaite.com/fox.mylesbraithwaite.com.html">Panda is monitoring Fox</a> and <a href="http://fox.mylesbraithwaite.com/munin/mylesbraithwaite.com/panda.mylesbraithwaite.com.html">Fox is monitoring Panda</a>) that way if one goes down the other will notify me.</p>
<p>I also moved my <a href="http://wiki.mylesbraithwaite.com/">Wiki</a> from <a href="http://dokuwiki.org/" title="A super simple and powerful wiki engine.">DokuWiki</a> to <a href="http://hatta.sheep.art.pl/">Hatta</a>. Hatta is a really simple wiki engine written in Python that use Mercurial for storage. Which means I just have to clone a repository to edit a page (you can clone the <a href="http://bitbucket.org/myles/wiki-pages/">my draft wiki</a> or <a href="http://wiki.mylesbraithwaite.com/hg/">my published wiki</a>). I am going to miss some of the more powerful features of DokuWiki so I have started working on my own wiki engine called <strong>Episteme</strong>.</p>
<p>Episteme will have some of my favorite feature of DokuWiki, Hatta, <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/">Confluence</a>, and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yaki/">Yaki</a>.</p>
