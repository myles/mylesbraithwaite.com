<p>This is some spam I received today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>To</strong>: me@mylesbraithwaite.com<br>
<strong>Subject</strong>: Private Invitation<br>
<strong>From</strong>: Mr  Yasir Ali<br>
<strong>Date</strong>: Sat, 14 Nov 2009 09:51:01 +0100</p>
<p>Dear: President/C.E.O.</p>
<p>Good Day.</p>
<p>It is my pleasure to request for your honest assistance. This request may seem strange but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously.</p>
<p>My name is Mr Yasir Ali from Pakistan. purchasing agent to leader of Jundollah militant group in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Due to the Pakistan Army's offensive in South Waziristan, I was mandated by a senior rebel leader to purchase arms and ammunition from a private dealer in Russia worth Ten Million American Dollars Only. The said amount was moved through Iran boarder on the 17Th of September 2009 to Russia.</p>
<p>It was quite unfortunate that upon my arrival, I immediately change my mind against purchasing of arms in the name of war of Islam. I have succeeded on diverting the fund into a security storage company.</p>
<p>I pray to Allah to forgive me for all the innocent people killed during my service to the rebel force. I have promise my self and Allah never to involve in any form of crime to humanity through out my life time.</p>
<p>In view of the above, I will never like to go back to Pakistan again because of my life and wish to invest this funds under your umbrella and supervision.</p>
<p>I will also seek your assistant to help me secure traveling documents for my wife and two children.</p>
<p>In summary.</p>
<p>I needed your assistant and protection to the funds. Base on the above detail information, I will highly appreciate if my request is given utmost priority and consideration.</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Mr Yasir Ali
