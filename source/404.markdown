You're in a room. It's dark. Silent. As your eyes become accustomed to the gloom you notice something on the wall opposite. Squinting, you read:

**404 Page Not Found**

It might be written in blood or something. I don't know. This story's gone on too long already.

What I'm trying to say is the page you're looking for, <script>document.write(window.location.href.toString().split(window.location.host)[1])</script>, can't be found. Sorry.

You're probably looking for the most recent post called {% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}[{{ post.title }}]({{ post.url }}){% endfor %}; but if you're completely lost, try the [home page](/). If you think I've made some kind of mistake (as unlikely as that sounds) you should [get in touch](mailto:me@mylesbraithwaite.com).</p>
