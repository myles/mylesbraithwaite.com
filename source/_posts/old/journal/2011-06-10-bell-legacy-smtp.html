<p>One of the large issues when trying to configure people's email usually comes to sending messages. If you/they are using Bell Internet (previously Sympatico) you can use a legacy SMTP server at <code>smtp1.sympatico.ca</code>. It will only work on Bell's ISP (not include your local Starbucks), so it would not be a good idea to configure it on a laptop. If they are working on a laptop the best idea is to see if their email provider provides an iterative SMTP port. Port numbers <code>587</code> and <code>2525</code> have become a somewhat standard alternative for email providers. If that doesn't work, another option would be to use the SSL server which is usually on port <code>465</code>.</p>
