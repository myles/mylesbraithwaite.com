<h3 id="an-email-from-panic">An Email from Panic</h3>
<p>I signed up for <a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/2009/12/transmit-beta-signup/">Transmit's Beta</a> and it looks like they had a lot of people signed up and now the Beta program is full. So they sent me an email informing me:</p>
<p><img alt="Sorry: the Transmit 4 beta group is full." src="http://uploads.mylesbraithwaite.com/blog_posts/179-took-note/automatied-eamil_small.png"></p>

<h3 id="lighthouse-strange-ui">Lighthouse strange UI</h3>
<p>I started using <a href="http://lighthouseapp.com/">Lighthouse</a> (a ticket tracker) a few days ago for <a href="http://asgardproject.org/" title="Asgard Project">Asgard</a>, <a href="http://i-del-icio-us.appspot.com/%20&quot;An%20iPhone%20interface%20for%20Delicious">iDelicious</a>, and a few other personal projects (while I wait for a new server to run <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">Jira</a>). Initial thoughts are it a really good, simple, easy to use ticket track. But as you can see from the screenshot below I always forget where the <em>Add new Ticket</em> button is located. I look left under the bar that has a bunch of <em>New</em> actions but I start freaking out because I don't see <em>New ticket</em>, then I remember to look right where their is a prominent button that say <em>Create new ticket</em>.</p>
