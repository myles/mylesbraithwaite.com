<blockquote>
<p>A quirk somewhere else in <strong>Instagram revealed the app uses a web view</strong> for
its entire timeline. This is something we knew, but had difficulty proving.
Something that, if you knew, might have made you think that Instagram was
worse application than it was.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The smart ones don’t tell you.</p>
<p>The designers and developers behind Instagram, Uber, and Basecamp are
incredibly talented and practiced; they care about consistent interface
design, enjoyable experiences, maintainability, and the reach of their apps.
They have the resources to maintain a native app on each platform, but they
don’t.</p>

<p>There is a myth in the mobile developers community that native applications are
more responsive and faster than using a web view or a PhoneGap-like library.</p>
