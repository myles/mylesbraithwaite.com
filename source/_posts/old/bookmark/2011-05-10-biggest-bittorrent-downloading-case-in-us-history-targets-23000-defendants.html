<blockquote>
<p>A <em>[United States of America]</em> federal judge in the case has agreed to allow the U.S. Copyright Group to subpoena internet service providers to find out the identity of <a href="http://cdn.mylesbraithwaite.com/media/uploads/posts/2011-05-10-biggest-bittorrent-downloading-case-in-us-history-targets-23000-defendants/nuimagediscovery.pdf">everybody who had illegally downloaded</a> (.pdf) the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm2584972032/tt1320253">2010 Sylvester Stallone flick</a> â€” meaning the number of defendants is likely to dramatically increase as new purloiners are discovered. Once an ISP gets the subpoena, it usually notifies the account holder that his or her subscriber information is being turned over to the Copyright Group, which last year <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/03/bittorrent/">pioneered the practice</a> of suing BitTorrent downloaders in the United States.</p>
