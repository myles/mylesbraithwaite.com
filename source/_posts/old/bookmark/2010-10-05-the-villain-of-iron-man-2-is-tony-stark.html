<blockquote>
<p>In Iron Man 2, Robert Downey Jr. is playing Stephen Colbert playing Tony Stark. Where he was a cool jerk in the first movie, this time around he's a loud jackass. And without giving too much away, every bad event in this movie happens because Tony Stark is a jackass.  This seems to be a conscious decision on the film-makers' part. If you take a drink every time Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle or Samuel L. Jackson accuses Tony of being a douche, you'll need a bathroom break about half an hour into the movie â€” and you can go ahead and take a whiz, because you won't miss anything for about an hour.</p>
