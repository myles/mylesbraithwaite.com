<blockquote>
<p>Tell me, what do the following have in common?</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying with a credit card.</li>
<li>Going to the emergency room</li>
<li>Adjusting your 401k.</li>
<li>Using your insurance card at the dentist.</li>
<li>Shopping around for the best car insurance.</li>
<li>A BNSF train pulling a Union Pacific coal car.</li>
<li>Transferring money between banks.</li>
<li>Filling a prescription.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the above industries are billion dollar players in our economy. All of the above industries write new COBOL and mainframe assembler programs.</p>
