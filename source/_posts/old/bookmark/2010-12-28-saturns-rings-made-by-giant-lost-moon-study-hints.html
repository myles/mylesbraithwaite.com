<blockquote>
<p>Saturn's rings might be the remains of a giant "lost" moon that was stripped of its icy shell before it crashed into the planet, new research suggests.</p>
<p>What's more, the new theory could help explain why relatively similar Jupiter ended up with several huge moons and only thin, faint rings.</p>
