<p>Looks like <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> really does suck as a blogging services. But more interesting individual blogs on all services have different uptime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Not all blogs are created equal, even within the same blogging service.</strong> Downtime can vary significantly between blogs on the same service, presumably depending on which servers the blogs are hosted on. Itâ€™s a similar situation to that of shared hosting, where you can end up on servers that perform worse than others for various reasons.</p>
