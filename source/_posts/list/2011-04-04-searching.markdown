* Five unopened boxes of **golf balls**.
* Three unopened cans of **tennis balls**.
* Seven **mix tapes** (the actually tape cassette kind). Two made by me the other five by other people (they had bitching album art).
* Two **mix CDs**. Both made by other people (didn't have great cover art).
* Three **short stories** and one **screen play** I wrote in High School.
* Five unfinished **original works of digital art**.
* A Lego **stop motion film** I made.
* A **short film** a friend and I made inspired by Catchier in the Rye.
* Three tape cassettes of the **Ninja Turtles** music.
* A **short film** a friend and I made inspired by 24.
* A **computer animation/stop motion film** a friend and I made inspired by Matrix.
* My high school yearbook from grade nine ([my picture](http://c.myl.be/5iUZ "Picture from my yearbook when I was fourteen.")).

## Things I Learned About Myself

1. When I was growing up the present one friend could give to another was a mix tape/CD.
2. I made a lot of films from 9th grade to 12th most had terrible production value (one had me smoking a cigarette).
3. When I was a teenager I had a lot of teenage angst.
