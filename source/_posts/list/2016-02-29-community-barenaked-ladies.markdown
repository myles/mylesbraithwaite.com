> **Jeff Winger**: Well he also listens to the Barenaked Ladies, go get their dumb asses to help you.
> 
> **Troy Barnes**: *[everyone gasps in horror]* Okay Jeff, you are clearly in a bad space today, but Pierce is our friend, and the Barenaked Ladies are triple platinum, are you?
> 
> **Jeff Winger**: Why does everyone leap to defend that band so aggressively and how much stuff do we have to go through this year before my friendship stops being questioned?
> 
> **Annie Edison**: Well maybe friendship is about going through a lot of stuff Jeff, and maybe BNL has two Billboard Awards to your zero!
> 
> **Jeff Winger**: Oh, okay, they're BNL now? We need a shorthand for the Barenaked Ladies. That's how fundamental they are
> 
> **Abed Nadir**: Fundamental.
> 
> **Jeff Winger**: You know what Pierce probably needs more than anything? Some space. Maybe I do too.
> 
> **Britta Perry**: *[yelling angrily]* You know what? Maybe we all need some space, to pull the knife out of the back of the most celebrated Canadian alt-rock band of the mid 90s, you selfish, jaded, ass!
