<p>It looks like Chips and Orang-Utans (and humans of course) are not the only primates that pass on knowledge in a social group. A recent study now suggests that Gorillas do infract pass on knowledge in a social group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Richard Byrne at the University of St Andrews, UK, and colleagues looked at how captive-bred gorillas picked apart stinging nettles to eat them. They noticed that the apes never detached the stinging leaf stalks and reduced their exposure to stings by squeezing nettles together.</p>
<p>"This fascinated us because, while wild gorillas in Rwanda also pick apart stinging nettles, they do so by removing stalks and folding, rather than squeezing, the nettles", says Byrne.</p>
