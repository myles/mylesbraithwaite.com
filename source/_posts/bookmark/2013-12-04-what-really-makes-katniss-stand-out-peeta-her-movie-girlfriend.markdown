Linda Holmes talks about gender dynamics in **Catching Fire** (the second Hunger Games film).

> But one of the most unusual things about Katniss isn't the way she defies typical gender roles for heroines, but the way Peeta, her arena partner and one of her two love interests, defies typical Hollywood versions of gender roles for boyfriends.
