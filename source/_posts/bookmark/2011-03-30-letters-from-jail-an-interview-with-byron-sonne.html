<p>Though I largely disagree with Byron idea of public disclosure in matters of security. From what I have read (in the paper, online, and the <a href="http://freebyron.org/">Free Bryron</a> wiki) about the case I would have to say that he is innocent. But because of the publication ban on the case I can't really be 100% sure.</p>

<h2 id="update">Update</h2>

<p>Byron Sonne <a href="/linked/2011/05/byron-sonne/">has been granted bail</a>.</p>
