<blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>In this model, the universe is a kind of cosmic Russian Doll, with all previous universes contained within the current one.</p>

    <p>That's an extraordinary discovery: evidence of something that occurred before the (conventional) Big Bang.</p>

    <p>Today, another group says they've found something else in the echo of the Big Bang. These guys start with a different model of the universe called eternal inflation. In this way of thinking, the universe we see is merely a bubble in a much larger cosmos. This cosmos is filled with other bubbles, all of which are other universes where the laws of physics may be dramatically different to ours.</p>
