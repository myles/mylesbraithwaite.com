This whole debate makes newcomers to run away, it's confusing, nonsense and more importantly a bubble, fairy dust, it doesn't exist and it shouldn't be there, It's only the Python and that's it.

If you're on the older version (_Python 2_ as you say), you're a decade behind, you should have upgraded at 2008.

You wanna say `Unicode` or `print` statement or `2to3`, or tiny stuff that are deprecated? If you forget to upgrade you hit those too, no surprise.
