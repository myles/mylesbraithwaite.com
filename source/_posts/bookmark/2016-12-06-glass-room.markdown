> The Glass Room is hands-down the most creative, interesting, and effective exploration of issues around [internet health](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/) I have ever seen. You won’t find dry white papers about net neutrality in here. Instead the space is filled with creative, dystopian artistic exhibitions and real-world product marketing materials for truly disturbing services like [Silver Mother](https://sen.se/silvermother/), which basically let’s you track your parents as if they were terrorists.
