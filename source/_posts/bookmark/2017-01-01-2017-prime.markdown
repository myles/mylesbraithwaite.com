title: 2017 is not just another prime number
---

TJ Wei on why 2017 is not just any prime number:

> 2017Ï€ (rounds to nearest integer) is a prime.
>
> 2017e (rounds to nearest integer ) is a prime.
>
> The sum of all odd primes up to 2017 is a prime number, i.e. 3+5+7+11+...+2017 is a prime number.
>
> The sum of the cube of gap of primes up to 2017 is a prime number. That is (3-2)^3 + (5-3)^3 + (7-5)^3 + (11-7)^3 + ... + (2017-2011)^3 is a prime number.
