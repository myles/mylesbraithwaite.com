> Faber's initial experience is precisely what one might expect: as companies
> shift to opt-in lists with customers who explicitly consent to receive
> messages, they are more likely to open the emails and to click on the links.
> I asked Faber about the experience to date and he indicated that the
> companyâ€™s list has unsurprisingly slimmed down, but that it is much more
> qualified, will grow back over time, and offers a more engaged audience,
> which he prefers.
