[This month's PyGTA](http://pygta.org/2010-02/pycondress/ "PyCon Dress Rehearsal") we will have three presenters talking about their upcoming [PyCon](http://us.pycon.org/2010 "PyCon United States 2010") talks. [Leigh Honeywell](http://hypatia.ca/) will be presenting [Teaching Python in Your Community](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/108/ "Think Globally, Hack Locally - Teaching Python in Your Community") -- her experience teaching a Python class at [HackLabTO](http://hacklab.to/ "Hack Lab Toronto"). [Greg Wilson](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~gvwilson) on [What We've Learned From Building Basie](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/112/ "What We've Learned From Building Basie") -- what a bunch of undergraduates accomplished building a [Django](http://djangoproject.org/ "Django Project")-based replacement for Trac called [Basie](http://basieproject.org/ "Basie Project"). [Mike C. Fletcher](http://www.vrplumber.com/) on [Debating 'til Dawn](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/111/ "Debating 'til Dawn: Topics to keep you up all night") -- will be presenting some of the best discussion/ideas/talks at [PyGTA](http://pygta.org/) the last three years in his attempt to make [PyCon](http://us.pycon.org/2010 "PyCon United States 2010") cool again.
