I am going to be talking about [XMPP](http://xmpp.org/) at [Tuesday](http://pygta.org/2010-04/jabber/ "Jabber/XMPP and Python")'s (tomorrow's) [PyGTA](http://pygta.org/) meeting at the [Linuxcaffe](http://linuxcaffe.ca/).

> XMPP is chat. It's the underlying protocol for open peer-to-peer communication systems, but what becomes possible when the peers are servers? How can you make your server a chatty teen?
>
> Myles Braithwaite uses XMPP a lot. He ships documents and data-sets across it that look nothing like the chatter of teenagers. He'll explain how he does this, why he does this, and how you can do it too.

Hope you will be able to make it out.
