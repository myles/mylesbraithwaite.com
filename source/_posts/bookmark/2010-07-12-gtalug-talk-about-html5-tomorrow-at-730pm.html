    <p>After four years since HTML4 was published (Dec. 1997) it looked
like the W3C was going to drop the HTML standard (based on SGML)
in favour of the more popular XHTML 1.1 (based on XML). A group
of browser developers, from Mozilla, Opera, and Apple, decided to
form a new working group (June 2004) called WHATWG (Web Hypertext
Application Technology Working Group) to create a new standard
called HTML5 that incorporated many features that would require
an extra plugin to be installed.</p>
