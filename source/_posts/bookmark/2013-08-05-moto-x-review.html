    <p>The Moto X’s most intriguing and maybe revelatory features reside in an application simply labeled "Assist." WIthin the app a suite of settings allow you to customize your phone for various scenarios — sort of like Apple’s "Do Not Disturb" on steroids. In a car.</p>

<p>This is the Moto X's one feature I am jealous about. Hopefully you can make customisable ones (e.x. I don't like to talk on the phone when I am walking).</p>
