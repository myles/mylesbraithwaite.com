Just published the new version of [Django Basic Tumblelog](http://myles.github.com/django-basic-tumblelog/) to [PyPi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-basic-tumblelog). With this release I decided to go with the "One Idea" methodology i.e. their is no Bookmarks, Videos, etc. Models anymore, just one Model called _Post_. I am working on some documentation that I hope to release by version 1.0.
