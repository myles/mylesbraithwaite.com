<p>Background Fetch looks like an interesting feature of iOS 7.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Facebook and other social media apps, background fetching means you’ll see an updated newsfeed the moment you fire it up. And for content apps like The New York Times or Instapaper, background fetching means you won’t have to wait for today’s edition or saved articles to load — the latest content should already be there when you open the app. Apple’s guidelines for iOS7 developers actually demand we avoid splash screens ‘or other startup experience.’</p>
