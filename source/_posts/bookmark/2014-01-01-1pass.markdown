1pass is a Python library and command line interface for [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword "1Password by Agile Bits") (a Windows and Mac OS X application for storing your passwords). I have already configured it in my OfflineIMAP and ESMTP configurations.

You can checkout the [source code to 1pass on GitHub](https://github.com/georgebrock/1pass "1pass").
