<p><a href="http://www.freerdp.com/">FreeRDP</a>, a fork of the rdesktop project, is changing to the Apache License from GPL 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This new long term goal for the project comes at a price. I do not believe we would be able to reach this goal using a reciprocal software license, or one that is often called viral. A free software license should help a project grow, not stand in its way. No, in order to become a de-facto standard implementation, we must move to permissive licensing that would make the software usable in the largest possible number of licensing scenarios. If we stick to LGPL/GPL, we will be restricting the possible licensing scenarios with permissive licenses, and we will also be imposing strong restrictions for proprietary licensing. How could we possibly aim at becoming a widely accepted de-facto standard implementation if we impose such restrictions?</p>
