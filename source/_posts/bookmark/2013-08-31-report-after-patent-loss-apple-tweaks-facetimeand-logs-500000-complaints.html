<p>Another great example of why we can't have nice things on the Internet because of patent trolls.</p>

<p>This time Apple's FaceTime an Audio and Video communication platform based on open standards (that was device to device instead of systems like Skype which require a middleman (aka a server)) that until this they lost this trial were going to release as an open protocol.</p>
