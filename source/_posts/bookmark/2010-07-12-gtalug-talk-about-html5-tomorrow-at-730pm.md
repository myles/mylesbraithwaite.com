I am going to be [talking about HTML5 at the next GTALUG meeting](http://gtalug.org/wiki/Meetings:2010-07).

> **HTML5 with Myles Braithwaite**
>
> After four years since HTML4 was published (Dec. 1997) it looked
> like the W3C was going to drop the HTML standard (based on SGML)
> in favour of the more popular XHTML 1.1 (based on XML). A group
> of browser developers, from Mozilla, Opera, and Apple, decided to
> form a new working group (June 2004) called WHATWG (Web Hypertext
> Application Technology Working Group) to create a new standard
> called HTML5 that incorporated many features that would require
> an extra plugin to be installed.
> 
> **Location**
>
> Room GB248, Galbraith Building, University of Toronto<br />
> 35 St George St<br />
> Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G8<br />
> University of Toronto
