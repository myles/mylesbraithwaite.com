<p>The best things about StackOverflow are these kind of questions that actually receive an answer and not a "I would like that information to".</p>

```vim
function! PlaySound()
	silent! exec '!afpaly ~/.vim/support/my_typewriter_sound.aiff &'
endfunction
autocmd CursorMovedI * call PlaySound()
```
