<p>It looks like Apple hide a Dropbox-like folder in iCloud:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If you want to try out the trick yourself, make sure "Documents And
Data" is turned on within iCloud settings, then navigate to Library
inside your Home folder, and then find Mobile Documents.</p>
<p>Then, throw some files into the folder. These files should sync to any
Macs where you're signed in using the same iCloud credentials.</p>
<p>Right click to create an "alias" of the Mobile Documents folder on
your desktop, and you're good to go.</p>
