<p><a href="http://twitter.com/NPsteve">Steve Murray</a> looks at why Thor (<em>Thor: The Dark World</em>) beat Superman (<em>The Man of Steel</em>) at the box office last year.</p>
<p>It's kind of interesting that D.C. Comics heroes are based off Judeo-Christian‎ archetypes, while Thor is from the Norse mythology (many of Marvel's characters are based (or come from) pre-Christian mythology).</p>
<p>If you interested in seeing superheroes from Islamic archetypes checkout <em>The 99</em> (if you don't know where to start checkout there crossover with the Justice League on <a href="http://www.comixology.com/JLA-The-99-Vol-1/comics-series/4839" title="JLA/The 99 on Comixology">Comixology</a>).﻿</p>
