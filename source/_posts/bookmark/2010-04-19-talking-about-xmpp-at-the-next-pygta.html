<p>I am going to be talking about <a href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> at <a href="http://pygta.org/2010-04/jabber/" title="Jabber/XMPP and Python">Tuesday</a>'s (tomorrow's) <a href="http://pygta.org/">PyGTA</a> meeting at the <a href="http://linuxcaffe.ca/">Linuxcaffe</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>XMPP is chat. It's the underlying protocol for open peer-to-peer communication systems, but what becomes possible when the peers are servers? How can you make your server a chatty teen?</p>
<p>Myles Braithwaite uses XMPP a lot. He ships documents and data-sets across it that look nothing like the chatter of teenagers. He'll explain how he does this, why he does this, and how you can do it too.</p>

<p>Hope you will be able to make it out.</p>
