<p>Interesting academic paper by <strong>Dorit Ron</strong> and <strong>Adi Shamir</strong> from the CompSci department at The Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel on how the <em>Dread Pirate Roberts</em> protected his Bitcoins.</p>
<p>Most interesting is that the Bitcoin community could have prevented the transfer of the F.B.I cised Bitcoins by not verifying the chain block:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>An interesting comment we would like to make is that the notion of seizing
bitcoins from a suspect's laptop is much trickier than the notion of seizing cash
from a suspect's safe, even if all the necessary keys are found by the FBI in both
cases. In the case of cash, once the money is hauled away, it is no longer available
to the suspect. However, let us assume that the Bitcoin community had noticed
the unusual activity, and had refused to pick up these FBI-initiated transactions
for verication as part of the official block chain. In this case, it would not help
the FBI that they set up the new account and had initiated those transfers -
their holdings would not be recognized as valid, and thus they would not be
able to exchange or auction them off. In addition, they could still be used by
either the suspect or by any one of his accomplices who happens to know the
secret key! Even if the community had been late in recognizing these events and
some miners would have picked up those transactions in the meantime, a 51%
majority of the computing power available to miners could have forked the block
chain just before these transactions, and grown a longer side chain which would
invalidate all the blocks that contain the FBI transactions. However, by now it
is probably too dicult to take such measures, and the seized bitcoins are no
longer usable by DPR.</p>
