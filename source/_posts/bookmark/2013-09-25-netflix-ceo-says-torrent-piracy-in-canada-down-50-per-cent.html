<p>I really wish all the Canadian politicians who are trying to pass <a href="http://balancedcopyright.gc.ca/eic/site/crp-prda.nsf/eng/home">The Copyright Modernization Act</a> would look at business like Netflix (and even Rdio) and their positive impact of piracy. Government's shouldn't try and pass legislation for failing business direction.</p>
