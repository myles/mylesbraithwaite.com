{% include c_image.html src='2014/218/monkeys-selfie-at-centre-of-copyright-brouhaha/brouhaha-selfie.jpg' alt="Brouhaha's Selfie" caption='This file is in the public domain, because as the work of a non-human animal, it has no human author in whom copyright is vested.' %}

<p>Photographer's claim is that the photo isn't in the public domain because the he did all the setup and all the monkey did was take the picture.</p>

<p>Wikimedia's claim is that for the photographer to claim copyright, they "would have had to make substantial contributions to the final image, and even then, they'd only have copyright for those alterations, not the underlying image". And because animals aren't people and don't have civil rights then the images fall under the public domain.</p>

<p>TODO insert pun about monkey business and copyright.</p>
