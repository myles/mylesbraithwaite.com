A GraphQL[^1] API created by reflection over a Postgres schema written in Node.js.

> With PostGraphQL, you can access the power of PostgreSQL through a well designed GraphQL server. PostGraphQL uses PostgreSQL reflection APIs to automatically detect primary keys, relationships, types, comments, and more providing a GraphQL server that is highly intelligent about your data.

[^1]: GraphQL is a data query language that provides a flexible syntax for client applications to describe how the data is consumed.
