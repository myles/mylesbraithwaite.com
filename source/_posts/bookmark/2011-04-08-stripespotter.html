<p><code>SrtipeSpotter</code> has got to be the coolest Open Source project of the year. From a picture of an animal with prominent stripes or patches the software can read it like a barcode. This will help Zoologist analyze animals without having to put a tracking device on them.</p>
<p>Imagine that you connected this to a photo sharing services like Flickr and were able to see if anyone else took a of that Zebra you saw in Kenya.</p>
