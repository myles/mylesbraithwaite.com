<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/jeffrey-goldberg/">Jeffrey Goldberg</a> offers some good advice to men travelling this holiday session:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Kilts. Think about it -- if you're a male, and you want to bollix-up the nonsensical airport security-industrial complex, one way to do so would be to wear a kilt. If nothing else, this will cause TSA employees to throw up their hands in disgust.</p>
