<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Docker is an awesome way to containerise any application running on Linux, but it has some shortfalls. Red Hat’s collaboration with dotCloud the company behind Docker will fix these and allow Docker run on almost any distribution of Linux (including RHEL and it’s derivatives). They will also integrate the technology that underpins the OpenShift PaaS (cartridges) so that the lifecycle of an application runtime can be managed.</p>
