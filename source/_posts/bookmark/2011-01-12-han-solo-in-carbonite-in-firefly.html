<blockquote>
<p>As it turns out, a Han Solo in Carbonite was brought on set since Nathan Fillion is such a huge Star Wars fan.  The props team joked around and added it to sets whenever they could, it apparently became a running joke.  It didn't get grabbed out of every scene before shooting though. </p>
