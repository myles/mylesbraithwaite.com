<p>Steve Gibson has a good overview on what's happening with TrueCrypt right now.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't panic the Open Crypto Audit is still taking place.</li>
<li>The Open Source community will most likely take over the project.</li>
<li>One of the original developers, known as <em>David</em>, was contacted. They said it had nothing to do with the audit, but just were tired of developing the software.</li>
</ol>
