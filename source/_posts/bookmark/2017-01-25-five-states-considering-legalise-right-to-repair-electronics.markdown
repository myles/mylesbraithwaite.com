title: Nebraska, Minnesota, New York, Massachusetts, and Kansas are Considering Bills to Legalize the "Right to Repair" Electronics
---

> The bills are squarely aimed at the “authorized repair” model that creates aftermarket monopolies dominated by the manufacturers themselves. For example, Apple [has never authorized an independent company](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-to-fix-everything) to repair iPhones, even though hundreds of companies do so every day (its authorized repair program is only for Mac computers).
