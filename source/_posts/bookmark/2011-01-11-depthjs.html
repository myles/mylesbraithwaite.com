<p>An interesting project by the MIT Media Lab to have a gesture-based web browsing experience. The have released the project under the AGPL license and <a href="http://github.com/doug/depthjs" title="DepthJS source on GitHub">you can clone it on GitHub</a>. I can see this being deployed in hospitals and mechanical shops. Where touching a screen or keyboard could contaminate your hands or the screen or keyboard.
