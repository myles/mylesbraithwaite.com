<p>I think this is the first large company (outside Apple) to use the Cocoa framework.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>Sony’s Networked Application Platform is a project designed to leverage the open source community to build and evolve the next generation application framework for consumer electronic devices.</p>

    <p>The developer program gives access to a developer community and resources like SDK, tools, documentation and other developers.</p>

    <p>The foundation upon which this project is base comes from the GNUstep community, whose origin dates back to the OpenStep standard developed by NeXT Computer Inc (now Apple Computer Inc.).  While Apple has continued to update their specification in the form of Cocoa and Mac OS X, the GNUstep branch of the tree has diverged considerably.</p>
