<p>It looks like more companies are buying new computers with Linux installed than installing Linux on old computers. This is really important because it shows that Linux has become more of a "testing" operating system. Companies are actually planing to have their servers running Linux.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>On Red Hat’s earnings conference call Tuesday CFO Charlie Peters noted that "the Windows market continues to be something that we're definitely going after and something we’ve made good progress on."</p>

    <p>Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst explained the dynamic.</p>

    <p>Typically you don’t get a situation where somebody has a Windows box and comes in and reinstalls Linux on top of it or vice versa. The competitive dynamic happens with new infrastructure coming in or new workloads coming in, new applications coming in. And so working well with, making the SAPs of the world or the Accentures of the world, or ensuring web applications are built on a LAMP stack. That’s really where the battle happens. The typical field of battle is actually who’s getting the incremental 500 servers of infrastructure at XYZ company. And that’s again certainly the OS is important, but it’s also ensuring that the applications run best on that, that the tooling is there, that the company has the skill set to manage. I think we do incredibly well there. And obviously it’s one of the reasons you’ve seen the growth.</p>
