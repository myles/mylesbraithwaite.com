> A security researcher has unearthed evidence showing that three browser-trusted certificate authorities (CAs) owned and operated by Symantec improperly issued more than 100 unvalidated [transport layer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) certificates. In some cases, those certificates made it possible to spoof HTTPS-protected websites.
