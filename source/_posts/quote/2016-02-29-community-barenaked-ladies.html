  <p class="blockquote__line"><strong class="blockquote__character">Jeff Winger</strong> <span class="blockquote__dialogue">Well he also listens to the Barenaked Ladies, go get their dumb asses to help you.</span></p>

  <p class="blockquote__action">Everyone, except Jeff, gasps in horror.</p>

  <p class="blockquote__line"><strong class="blockquote__character">Troy Barnes</strong> <span class="blockquote__dialogue">Okay Jeff, you are clearly in a bad space today, but Pierce is our friend, and the Barenaked Ladies are triple platinum, are you?</span></p>

  <p class="blockquote__line"><strong class="blockquote__character">Jeff Winger</strong> <span class="blockquote__dialogue">Why does everyone leap to defend that band so aggressively and how much stuff do we have to go through this year before my friendship stops being questioned?</span></p>

  <p class="blockquote__line"><strong class="blockquote__character">Annie Edison</strong> <span class="blockquote__dialogue">Well maybe friendship is about going through a lot of stuff Jeff, and maybe BNL has two Billboard Awards to your zero!</span></p>

  <p class="blockquote__line"><strong class="blockquote__character">Jeff Winger</strong> <span class="blockquote__dialogue">Oh, okay, they're BNL now? We need a shorthand for the Barenaked Ladies. That's how fundamental they are.</span></p>

  <p class="blockquote__line"><strong class="blockquote__character">Abed Nadir</strong> <span class="blockquote__dialogue">Fundamental.</span></p>

  <p class="blockquote__line"><strong class="blockquote__character">Jeff Winger</strong> <span class="blockquote__dialogue">You know what Pierce probably needs more than anything? Some space. Maybe I do too.</span></p>

  <p class="blockquote__line"><strong class="blockquote__character">Britta Perry</strong> <span class="blockquote__expression">yelling angrily</span> <span class="blockquote__dialogue">You know what? Maybe we all need some space, to pull the knife out of the back of the most celebrated Canadian alt-rock band of the mid 90s, you selfish, jaded, ass!</span></p>
