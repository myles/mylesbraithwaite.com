<p><strong>Frigga</strong> is basically a pretty wrapper around <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-contacts">Django Contacts</a> so you could run it like a CRM or contact management system for people who aren't comfortable with the Django Administration application.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Frigga is a character in <em>Journey into Mystery</em> (i.e. Thor).</p>
