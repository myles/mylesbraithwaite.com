I am really getting excited for this weekend's [PodCamp](http://2011.podcamptoronto.com/ "PodCamp Toronto 2011") in Toronto. I have been wanting to start a Podcast for the last five or so years so I am hoping this conference will finally give me the kick in the butt I need.

The second thing is [next months GTALUG meeting](http://gtalug.org/wiki/Meetings:2011-03 "Braindump: Taking Notes in Emacs Org-Mode - Sacha Chua") talk with [Sacha Chua](http://sachachua.com/blog/) on Org-Mode, an Emacs plugin that allows text to be organized into discrete sections that are related in a tree structure or hierarchy, basically an [Outliner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner "A Wikipedia article on Outliner's"). I have been using [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) for about seven years and [OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnioutliner/) for the past couple of months so I am really looking forward to how people actually work in the Emacs environment.
