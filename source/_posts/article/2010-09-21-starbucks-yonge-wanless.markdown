Last night after a heated GTALUG PaC meeting I came home to [read a tweet](http://twitter.com/tomlowshang/status/25067260937) from [Tom Low-Shang](http://twitter.com/tomlowshang) about my win as Mayor of your [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.ca/en-ca/_Our+Stores/_Store+Locator/StoreLocatorMap.htm?StoreKey=102546) on [Yonge & Wanless](http://foursquare.com/venue/213804). I would like to thank all who helped with my Mayoral checkins. The many late night and early morning coffee strategy meetings keep me going. We ran a good an honest race against the previous Mayor and came out victories.
