**Frigga** is basically a pretty wrapper around [Django Contacts](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-contacts) so you could run it like a CRM or contact management system for people who aren't comfortable with the Django Administration application.

**Update**: Frigga is a character in _Journey into Mystery_ (i.e. Thor).
