Back in February I tweeted "Starting work on #Episteme today."[#](http://twitter.com/mylesb/status/8635677939 "Tweet on 4th Feb 2010 at 10:17 AM"). A few hours latter I got the following query in an email:

**Episteme** is a wiki engine (more of a wiki library) I am currently working on (I have actually been working on it for the last two years). It was originally a fork of [Yaki](http://code.google.com/p/yaki/) (which powers [The Tao of Mac](http://the.taoofmac.com/)), then was powered by [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), and now is a fork of [Hatta](http://hatta.sheep.art.pl/) (not so much as a fork because I am still going to be using Hatta's `WikiStorage` module).

So why am I working on yet-another-wiki-engine?

*   I like flat files (easy to backup using rsync).
*   I think that [Relation databases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system) (like MySQL and PostgreSQL) were not design for wiki documents.
*   I like storing the documents in a Revision Control System so I can edit them in a text editor.
*   I like being able to search.
*   I don't ware the same cloths every day why should I have to use the same markup language.

This is an example of a wiki document:

```
Title: Python
Tags: python, programming
Content-Type: text/x-wiki

**Python** is a dynamic programming language.

I am using [RFC822](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/) (similar to an email) for meta information (title, tags, markup, date, author, etc).

Episteme will always be a work in progress and many never be released.
