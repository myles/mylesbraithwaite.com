Just got invited to [Novell Vibe](https://vibe.novell.com) by [Tom](http://tomlowshang.blogspot.com/ "Tom Low-Shang"). It is a really interesting idea for realtime communication but way to confusing. One cool feature of Vibe is that it supports capture (you get the email address `<username>@vibe.novell.com`).

But why make me have multiple accounts per email address, that means I have to have to have at least five different accounts.

Anyways I hope to have a review of Vibe up in a few days (or weeks). If you would like to communicate with me on Vibe my username is [myles](https://vibe.novell.com/myles).
