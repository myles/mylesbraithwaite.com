<p>I took a look at the email headers and found this <tt>X-Mailer: LinkAssistant (http://www.link-assistant.xxx)</tt>. A quick web lookup brought up an application called <a href="http://www.link-assistant.com/linkassistant/" rel="nofollow">LinkAssistant</a> and one of the features is:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote" cite="http://www.link-assistant.com/linkassistant/">
	<p>

<p>I am not a fan of SEO but this is just crossing a line. A lot of <a href="http://calacanis.com/2007/02/07/why-people-hate-seo-and-why-smo-is-bulls-t/" title="Why people hate SEO... (and why SMO is bulls$%t)">people</a> <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000835.html" title="SEOs: the New Pornographers of the Web">more</a> intelligent <a href="/blog/2007/may/18/morality-and-web-marketing/" title="Morality and Web Marketing">than me</a> have weigh in one this topic but I am going to reiterate one idea: <strong>If you write good content Google will index your site and give you a high page ranking</strong>.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote" cite="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4141.html">
	<p>90% of SEO is simple rules for building clean HTML. The other 10% is that SEOs are really just life coaches who need to transform their clients into something awesome that people actually care about. What you really need to optimize for is being awesome. And that's a bit harder than pulling some SEO out of your magic bag of tricks.</p>
