Last night at [PyGTA](http://pygta.org/2010-01/tornado/ "PyGTA - Tornado Hacking"), [Mike](http://blog.vrplumber.com/index.php?/archives/2418-Tornado-PyGTA-this-month,-PyCon-Dress-Rehearsal-next.html "Tornado @ PyGTA this month, PyCon Dress Rehearsal next") gave a short talk/demo about his findings using [Tornado](http://tornadoweb.org) and [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) to write a real time chat and voting application for [his PyCon talk](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/talks/).

Tornado is a lightweight non-blocking web server created by [FriendFeed](http://bret.appspot.com/entry/tornado-web-server "The technology behind Tornado, FriendFeed's web server") and Open Source by [Facebook](http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&story=301 "Tornado: Facebook's Real-Time Web Framework for Python"). The API is similar to [web.py](http://webpy.org/) and App Engine's [webapp framework](http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&story=301 "Tornado: Facebook's Real-Time Web Framework for Python"). Mike's ending comments was that Tornado can out perform Twisted. But he found he had to write a lot of code to do things that were built into Twisted (or any other modern web framework) already.

His thoughts on CouchDB:

> I'm really beginning to regret the choice of CouchDB for the back-end. It's working perfectly well, but I have literally dozens of pieces of code hanging around for doing SQL-based paging... none of which are applicable to CouchDB.

This website (and a few other sites I manage) will be moving from [Apache 2](http://httpd.apache.org "Apache HTTPD") and [WSGI](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/ "mod_wsgi") to Tornado and [Nginx](http://nginx.net) [#](http://twitter.com/mylesb/status/7772733185 "Working on a new backend for my website (Tornado, Supervisord, & Nginx). My current setup is Apache2 and WSGI. -- on Twitter at 14th Jan 6:56 PM"). It will still be built on top of [Django](http://djangoproject.org) thought so most of the issues Mike was talking about wouldn't apply to me.
