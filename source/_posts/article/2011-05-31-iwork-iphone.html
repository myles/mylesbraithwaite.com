<p>Apple released <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/05/31iwork.html" title="Apple iWork Now Available For iPhone &amp; iPod touch Users">iWork</a> (Pages, Keynote, and Numbers) for the iPhone (and iPod Touch) today and coincidentally I had to write an actually print on a dead tree, lick a stamp, and put in an envelope letter.</p>

{% include c_image.html src='2011/151/iwork-iphone/iwork-pages.png' alt="Pages (iWork) for Apple's iPhone 4" %}

<p>It a decent enough word processor but I still prefer using <a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/" title="Elements - Dropbox powered text editor for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch from Second Gear">Elements</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> (I am now using <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">iA Writer</a> on my <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/mac" title="iA Writer for Mac OS X">Mac</a> and <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/ipad" title="iA Writer for iPad">iPad</a>).</p>
