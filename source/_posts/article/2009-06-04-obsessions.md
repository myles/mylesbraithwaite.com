[TED](http://www.ted.com/ "Technology Entertainment Design") talk by [Adam Savage](http://www.adamsavage.com/) (of [MythBusters](http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/mythbusters.html)) about obsessions, starting with his own obsession over owing a replica of a [Dodo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo) skeleton to modeling a the [Maltese Falcon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maltese_Falcon) [Falcon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maltese_Falcon#The_falcon).
