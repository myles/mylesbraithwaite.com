<p>Ever since I read <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Web Design</a> by Ethan Marcotte I wanted to make my website work on browser sizes between 1000 to 300 pixel. I had something which was essentially a hack up for a long time but that was pretty much rubbish. I started using the <a href="http://lessframework.com/">Less Framework 4</a> (a CSS framework for creating responsive websites) for <a href="http://mylesbraithwaite.com/journal/2011/04/what-the-frigga/" title="What The Frigga">Frigga</a>.</p>
<p>Less Framework provides four different layouts: Default, Tablet, Mobile, and Wide Mobile (see examples at the bottom of this post). This is great because about 10% of my traffic comes from people who are using tablets or mobile phones.</p>
