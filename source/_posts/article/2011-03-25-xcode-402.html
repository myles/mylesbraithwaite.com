<p>On the 10th March, 2011 at 7:29am, I tweeted about having to download 4.24GB for Xcode 4:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote--tweet twitter-tweet">
    <p>So Xcode 4 is 4.24GB and is only available on the App Store. So ever update means I will have to re-download +4GB.</p>

<p>While Xcode 4.0.1 is out and I have to download another 4GB install file.</p>
