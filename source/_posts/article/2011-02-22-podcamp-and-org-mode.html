<p>I am really getting excited for this weekend's <a href="http://2011.podcamptoronto.com/" title="PodCamp Toronto 2011">PodCamp</a> in Toronto. I have been wanting to start a Podcast for the last five or so years so I am hoping this conference will finally give me the kick in the butt I need.</p>
<p>The second thing is <a href="http://gtalug.org/wiki/Meetings:2011-03" title="Braindump: Taking Notes in Emacs Org-Mode - Sacha Chua">next months GTALUG meeting</a> talk with <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/">Sacha Chua</a> on Org-Mode, an Emacs plugin that allows text to be organized into discrete sections that are related in a tree structure or hierarchy, basically an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner" title="A Wikipedia article on Outliner's">Outliner</a>. I have been using <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> for about seven years and <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a> for the past couple of months so I am really looking forward to how people actually work in the Emacs environment.</p>
