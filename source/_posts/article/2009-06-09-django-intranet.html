<div class="update">
    <p><strong>29th April 2011</strong>: I have started working on a <a href="http://mylesbraithwaite.com/journal/2011/04/what-the-frigga/" title="What The Frigga">CRM application called Frigga</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>At work I started developing a intranet, nothing to complicated just an address book, microblog, timesheet, and forum. I knew from the beginning of development I wanted to release the final project open source. But it was developed in the monolithic approach (one project for multiple ideas) so instead I am releasing one sentence ideas:</p>

<ul>
    <li>django-blogs: A multi-person blog similar to MovableType.</li>
    <li>django-bugle: A microblog. (This isn't my originally code I forked it off <a href="http://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willson</a>'s <a href="http://github.com/simonw/bugle_project">Bugle Project</a> and made it a more portable application.)</li>
    <li>django-calendar: This is a fork of my <a href="/calendar/">Asgard Calendar</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="http://github.com/myles/django-contacts/tree/master">django-contacts</a>: An address book application we are using to keep track of employee contact information.</li>
    <li>django-forums: A Django Forum application.</li>
    <li><a href="http://github.com/myles/django-issues/tree/master">django-issues</a>: An issue tracker.</li>
    <li>django-projects: An internal project tracker.</li>
    <li><a href="http://github.com/myles/django-timecard/tree/master">django-timecard</a>: A timesheet without projects or issues.</li>
    <li><a href="http://github.com/myles/django-timesheet/tree/master">django-timesheet</a>: A timesheet for projects, tasks, and issues.</li>
    <li>django-voting: An <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html">Apache Style</a> voting application.</li>
</ul>

<p>I still have to release django-voting, django-projects, django-forums, django-calendar, django-bugle, and django-blogs which will probably be some time next week and I also want to do a <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/">Pinax</a> style release at the end of the month.</p>
