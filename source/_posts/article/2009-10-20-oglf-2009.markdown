Inspired by [Andrew Currie](http://acurrie.posterous.com) [What I'll be checking out at #oglf09](http://acurrie.posterous.com/what-ill-be-checking-out-at-oglf09-remember-i) here is what talks I am going to be attending at this years [Ontario Linux Fest](http://onlinux.ca/ "Ontario [GNU] Linux Fest").

### 10 a.m. - **[Enterprise Content Management Meets Open Source](http://onlinux.ca/node/76)** with [Cheryl McKinnon](http://onlinux.ca/node/75)

> Digital content is the lifeblood of any business in the information economy and companies ignore the care and feeding of electronic content at their own peril. ECM (Enterprise Content Management) could be one of the hottest areas of open source in 2010 and beyond. Attend this session to learn about the fundamentals of ECM - why the technology matters and why business users care about it. Learn the basics of content lifecycle management, what compliance means to information management professionals and why the time is right to change some of the perceptions about open source for business applications.

### 11 a.m. - **[Ubuntu Netbook and Moblin Remixes](http://onlinux.ca/node/95)** with [Jorge O. Castro](http://onlinux.ca/node/94)

> Netbooks are all the rage lately and there are a plethora of choices of what to run on your netbook. In this talk I will demo the newest versions of the Ubuntu Netbook Remix and the Ubuntu Moblin Remix and highlight the features of both environments. This talk is meant for people who might be new to Linux and want a glimpse of what's happening with netbooks.

### 12 p.m. - **[Introduction to the Beagleboard](http://onlinux.ca/node/78)** with [Robert P.J. Day](http://onlinux.ca/node/77)

> For only $149 (US), you too can get into the world of embedded Linux computing with the ARM-based Beagleboard. Speaker Rob Day will give an overview of the board, plus demonstrate it running at least one of the Angstrom and Android operating systems.

### 2 p.m.

[My](http://onlinux.ca/node/141) [Apache CouchDB](http://onlinux.ca/node/142) talk.

### 3 p.m. - **[Enterprise grade messaging in Fedora with Apache Qpid](http://onlinux.ca/node/116)** with [Rajith Attapattu](http://onlinux.ca/node/115)

> Apache Qpid is an enterprise grade messaging solution with a proven track record and a growing community. It is currently in live production in several large scale financial institutions. Qpid is a multi language implementation of the [AMQP protocol](http://www.amqp.org/) with brokers in c++ and java and clients in c++,java,python,ruby and c#. It provides infrastructure for scalable, reliable, secure, low latency messaging that can be used in a myriad of applications not just enterprise messaging. From a community aspect it is one of the first open source projects to receive a substantial contribution from Microsoft. Recently Microsoft contributed a WCF client and provided substantial support by way of funding developers to work on a windows port of the c++ broker. It has a growing community with contributions from large organizations, academic institutions, individual contributors and google summer of code students ..etc. This talk will provide an overview of Apache Qpid and discuss how it could benefit your community project or your organization using examples. It will also cover how to get hold of the bits and better yet how to become a contributor.

### 4 p.m.

I will be in the [GTALUG booth](http://gtalug.org/ "Greater Toronto Area Linux User Group") talking to folks.
