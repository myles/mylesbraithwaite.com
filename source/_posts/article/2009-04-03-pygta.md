On 21 April 2009 at 7:30pm I am going to be giving a talk about [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/) at the [linuxcaffe](http://linuxcaffe.ca/).

[Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/) is a platform to building and hosting web applications on Googleâ€™s infrastructure (which is sometimes called <abbr title="Platform as a Service">PaaS</abbr>). It has a pay-for-what-you-use payment level but anything [below five million pageviews a month](http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/general.html#quota).
