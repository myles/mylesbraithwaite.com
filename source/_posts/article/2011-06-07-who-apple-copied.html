<p>People on Twitter keep posting that Apple essential copied everything from Android in their new iOS 5. While they went further than that:</p>
<h2 id="microsoft">Microsoft</h2>
<p>Apple's new <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a> (formally MobileMe (formally .Mac (formally iTools))) service copies one of my favourite features of the now dead <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Kin">Microsoft Kin</a> (what Microsoft did after they bought <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_%28company%29">Danger</a> the maker of the popular Hiptop/Sidekick) when you take a picture that picture is automagically uploaded to Apple's iCloud service.</p>
<h2 id="dropbox">Dropbox</h2>
<p>When editing a document in the iWork suite (Pages, Keynote, and Numbers) your document will be uploaded to their iCloud service to be easily accessed from any of your iDevices. Also AirDrop in Mac OS X Lion is basically a Peer-to-Peer file share that will allow you to share entire folders between multiple computers and users.</p>
<h2 id="google">Google</h2>
<p>The notification system.</p>
<h2 id="rim">RIM</h2>
<p>iMessage is a blatant copy of <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/apps-software/blackberrymessenger/">BlackBerry Messenger</a>.</p>
<h2 id="remember-the-milk">Remember the Milk</h2>
<p>iOS 5 will include a new application called <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios5/features.html#reminders">Reminders</a> for tasks. One cool feature will you will be able to setup a <em>Location Reminder</em> for when you arrive or leave a location. Apple has never been able to do tasks while, iCal has probably the worst task management of any system ever developed (it's also the worst calendar management system ever developed).</p>
<h2 id="readablity-and-instapaper">Readablity and Instapaper</h2>
<p>Safari will have a feature called <em>Reading List</em> where you will be able to save unread Web site that will sync between your iDevices. iOS 5 Safari will also have the same feature as Safari for the Mac where with a click of a button you will get an easier to display version of the website.</p>
