[Ben The Bodyguard](http://benthebodyguard.com/), an iPhone application that will keep you securest safe was just released on the iOS App Store ether this morning or last night. It a pretty cool application that will encrypt your Passwords (web login, bank account, credit card, passport, membership, serial number, and driver's license), Notes, Contacts, and Appointments (really just notifications).

The only real issue I might have with the application in the future is Ben. Similar to Microsoft's [Office Assistant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant), he is really the major mascot of the application. He doesn't get in the way like Clippy, but it might be an issue in the future. But until then [Ben The Bodyguard](http://benthebodyguard.com/) will be on my home screen.
